# Arduino-shield-2-7segment-with-pot
This shield has evolved from mid-air-mounted through-hole domponents, via OpenScad-generated pcb-design to the latest Kicad-SMD-design with all analog inputs of Arduino Uno brougth out. We have been etching at school with pre-synthesized UV-sensitive copper pcbs. I might post a tutorial at our present process witch produces good quality, although tideous.
